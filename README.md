# Shop-Shop (refactoring) 
State
* enhance an existing e-commerce platform called Shop-Shop. To do this, you’ll centralize all of the application's data in state globally to make it easier to share state across the entire application. You’ll also create a shopping cart for the application, add offline functionality, and process secure online payments with a service called Stripe.

## What You Will Learn
Explain and identify use cases for global state management.

Use the Context API and React Hooks to manage Redux-like global state in a React application.

Implement the Stripe payment platform in a MERN application.

## You’ll use the following tools in this module:
`Stripe` (Links to an external site.) is a suite of online payment processing APIs that powers commerce for online businesses of all sizes, allowing them to accept and process payments online. You’ll use the `stripe` (Links to an external site.) npm package to integrate Stripe into your application.

`Stripe.js` (Links to an external site.) is Stripe’s JavaScript library for building payment flows. It uses Stripe Elements, a set of prebuilt, customizable UI components to allow platforms to collect sensitive payment information. Stripe.js also provides a single interface for Apple Pay, Google Pay, and the Payment Request API. For the purposes of this module's application, you’ll use the `@stripe/stripe-js` (Links to an external site.) npm package to redirect your app to a prebuilt Stripe checkout page.
