`Stripe` (Links to an external site.) is a suite of online payment processing APIs that powers commerce for online businesses of all sizes, allowing them to accept and process payments online. You’ll use the `stripe` (Links to an external site.) npm package to integrate Stripe into your application.

`Stripe.js` (Links to an external site.) is Stripe’s JavaScript library for building payment flows. It uses Stripe Elements, a set of prebuilt, customizable UI components to allow platforms to collect sensitive payment information. Stripe.js also provides a single interface for Apple Pay, Google Pay, and the Payment Request API. For the purposes of this module's application, you’ll use the `@stripe/stripe-js` (Links to an external site.) npm package to redirect your app to a prebuilt Stripe checkout page.
